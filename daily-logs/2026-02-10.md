## Playtech (PTEC.L) Deep Dive for Nam

Nam asked about Playtech vs Evolution lawsuit and stock valuation. Did extensive research session.

### Key Findings
- **Evolution AB suing Playtech** in NJ Superior Court (Atlantic County, Judge John C. Porto)
- Playtech hired Black Cube (Israeli intel firm) in 2020 to investigate Evolution, paid £1.8M+ with success fees tied to license revocation
- Evolution seeking $14B+ damages (defamation, trade libel, fraud, business interference)
- NJ regulators cleared Evolution — no enforcement action
- PTEC stock crashed 30-38% in Oct 2025 when named as defendant

### Snaitech Sale (Major Balance Sheet Event)
- Sold Italian subsidiary Snaitech to Flutter for **€2.3B** (completed April 2025)
- Paid ~€1.8B special dividend (€5.73/share)
- Repaid €150M senior secured notes
- Company now essentially **debt-free**, pure B2B software business

### Financials (Post-Snaitech)
- FY25 Adj EBITDA: €195M+ (beat €177M consensus by 10%)
- Medium-term target: €250-300M EBITDA, €70-100M FCF
- Market cap: ~£920M (~€1.1B)
- EV/EBITDA: ~5-6x (peers trade 8-12x)
- 52-week range: 210-814p, current ~325p

### Scenario Model I Built for Nam
| Scenario | Odds | Price Target |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Settlement | 42% | 500p |
| UPEPA/anti-SLAPP win | 17% | 575p |
| Case drags on | 23% | 325p |
| Trial loss | 13% | 100p |
| Case dropped | 5% | 700p |
| **Weighted EV** | | **~410-431p** |

- Bankruptcy threshold: damages above €800M-1B
- Realistic damage range if loss: €200-500M
- Walk-away odds: 10-15%, target 460-500p
- Expected upside from current: ~26%

### Feb 5 Catalyst
- EBITDA guidance upgrade triggered 7% initial pop
- Continued re-rating through week, 13% day
- Analysts upgrading (Peel Hunt raised targets, Buy rating)
- Americas (US + Mexico) growth driving momentum

### Court Timeline
- Last hearing: Dec 19, 2025 (sanctions denied)
- Possible March 3 hearing (Nam mentioned, unconfirmed)
- No specific 2026 trial date public yet
- Set up **monitoring cron** (Mon/Wed/Fri 9AM PT, Haiku tier) for court date updates → posts to #trading-hq

### Nam's Interest
- Modeling share price scenarios around lawsuit outcomes
- Wants to track court dates (monitoring set up)
- Sees value play if lawsuit settles favorably

## Connect Keeper Project (Major Focus)
- Chrome/Brave extension for saving LinkedIn-style profiles
- Using Neon database + Cloudinary for photos
- Nam testing on his local MacBook (not Mac Mini)
- Wants to save profiles from **message pages**, not just profile pages
- Key features requested: auto-grab photos, location, telegram/whatsapp contact info
- Pushed extension to GitHub (worldcash1/connect-keeper-extension)
- Web app: connect-keeper-v2, deployed on Vercel
- Privacy-sensitive: "i have people around so i dont want to start navigating the site"

## Earnings Tracker Progress
- Continued building trade journal — separating IC/IF, straddles, calendars into own dashboards
- Nam prefers "IF" (iron fly) label over "IC" (iron condor) — all his trades are actually iron flies
- Built auto-close detection and open trade tracking via Schwab API cron
- Nam has ~1800 shares of AI (C3.ai) — entered as earnings trade
- Pre-trade pipeline: wants early-day bid/ask rankings to know which tickers to research further
- App URL: https://app-five-mu-29.vercel.app

## Search/Web Upgrade
- Nam exploring Perplexity Sonar Pro vs Brave vs Grok for web search
- Decided to switch to Grok search first, willing to extend X API subscription if results are good
- Has old Perplexity API key, considering pay-per-use vs monthly
- Frustrated when Alfred wasn't responding in #briefings channel (responsiveness issue)

## Links Shared
- samuel_gibson X post (early AM)
- Michael Dell X post (morning)
- Firecrawl X post (late night) — interest in web scraping tools

## 🧠 Auto-Extracted Insights

**Preferences:**
- Prefers "iron fly" (IF) terminology over "iron condor" (IC) — wants labels updated across the system
- Wants to save contacts from messaging pages, not just profile pages (convenience-first UX)
- Prefers Neon over other DB options for Connect Keeper ("lets stick with neon")
- Quick decision-maker: picks Option B immediately, says "lets do it" without deliberation
- Wants pre-trade bid/ask rankings early in the day for quick scanning, not deep reports

**Decisions:**
- Switch web search to Grok (leveraging existing X API subscription)
- Willing to extend X API subscription if Grok search proves valuable
- Chose auto-close detection over manual close for earnings trades
- All IC trades relabeled to IF — they're the same structure in his strategy
- Connect Keeper: auto-sync to Neon + Cloudinary photo backup

**Patterns:**
- Late night builder: major work sessions from midnight to 2AM+ (Connect Keeper, Earnings Tracker, search config)
- Rapid context switching: jumped between Connect Keeper, Earnings Tracker, Briefings/search, and PTEC research in one day
- Sends screenshots to show issues rather than describing them verbally
- Gets frustrated when Alfred doesn't respond quickly ("are you there?", "??", "how come your not responding")
- Pastes terminal output directly into Discord when debugging (git clone, find commands)
- Privacy-aware in social settings ("i have people around")

**Interests:**
- Playtech (PTEC.L) as value play — deep research into lawsuit, Snaitech sale, scenario modeling
- Web scraping tools (shared Firecrawl link late at night)
- Michael Dell content (AI/data center connection to investment thesis)
- Connect Keeper — networking/relationship management tool (new project)

**Pain Points:**
- Alfred unresponsive in certain Discord channels — causes visible frustration
- Git clone double-nesting (connect-keeper-extension/connect-keeper-extension/) confused him
- Extension not working on first load — needed debugging help
- Schwab data accuracy: his spreadsheet had incorrect contract amounts, trusts Schwab API as source of truth over manual records

**Relationships:**
- No new people mentioned today — focused on solo project work
