## OpenClaw Update & Web Search Provider Switch

- **OpenClaw 2026.2.9** is running (updated Feb 9)
- Key new feature: **Grok (xAI) added as web_search provider** (PR #12419)
- Config now supports 3 providers: Brave, Perplexity, Grok

### Web Search Pricing Research
- **Brave Free**: 2K queries/mo, 1/sec (current, hitting rate limits)
- **Brave Base AI**: $5/1K queries (20/sec, 20M/mo)
- **Brave Pro AI**: $9/1K queries (50/sec, unlimited)
- **Perplexity**: ~$3-6/1K queries (token-based via OpenRouter)
- **Grok xAI**: $5/1K web search invocations + token costs

### Switch Attempt: Brave → Grok
- Changed `tools.web.search.provider` to `grok`
- Set `tools.web.search.grok.apiKey` (tried both keys from .zshrc and secrets/xai.env)
- **Result: Empty responses** — Grok search connects but returns "No response"
- xAI web search uses Responses API with tool calls, not simple search endpoint
- OpenClaw's Grok search integration may be new/buggy in 2026.2.9
- **Status: Need to either revert to Brave or troubleshoot further**
- Nam willing to extend xAI subscription if Grok search works well

### Two xAI API Keys Found
- `.zshrc`: `xai-kjxTN...` (used for model access)
- `secrets/xai.env`: `xai-GexGS...` (separate key)
- Neither worked for web search

### Nam Context
- Nam's xAI subscription ($200/mo) is scheduled to cancel at end of 30 days
- Willing to extend if Grok search delivers good results
- Doesn't need both Brave AND Perplexity — they're alternatives for same slot

### Gateway Restart Issue
- Each `openclaw gateway restart` kills the session, causing ~30s blackout
- Nam noticed gaps in responsiveness during restarts
- Need to warn before restarting, or batch config changes

## Overnight Maintenance (4:00-7:00 AM)

### Cron Health
- Auto-backups: Running clean, workspace had no changes to commit
- Schwab token refresh: All successful (~every 25 min)
- Local rsync backups: Running fine (8.6MB synced)
- **Issue: Massive cron duplicates** — backup/refresh crons fire 10+ copies per cycle, wasting tokens

### Cron Errors Noted
- **Estimize login failed** — credentials invalid, trial may have expired early (was ~Feb 23)
- **alphavantage/finnhub** — API keys not configured
- **Earnings intel scan** — Only confirmed NVDA (Feb 25), missing data for other tickers

### Morning Brief Highlights (6:33 AM)
- **HOOD** upgraded to Outperform by Wolfe ($125 PT, 43% upside)
- **ABVX** M&A speculation wave, analyst support
- **TSLA** positive on Semi/energy updates
- **IREN** mixed — BTC headwinds vs AI pivot
- Macro: CPI Feb 13, Fed on hold, BTC ~$69K

### Pending for Nam
1. Fix duplicate cron firing (10x per cycle = token waste)
2. Estimize subscription status check
3. Grok web search still broken (from earlier)
