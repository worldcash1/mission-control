## Earnings Research Skills Built

Created comprehensive earnings research toolkit:

### Skills Created/Updated
| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **sentiment-scanner** | X + StockTwits + News sentiment analysis |
| **transcript-analyzer** | Earnings call transcript analysis |
| **earnings-research** | Full research report orchestrator |

### Whisper Number Integration
- Added `estimize.py` script to earnings-research skill
- Calculates implied whisper from historical beat patterns
- Vol-selling signal: 🟢 FAVORABLE (<4% gap), 🟡 CAUTION (4-7%), 🔴 AVOID (>7%)
- Works as proxy until real Estimize data integrated

### PYPL Analysis (Earnings Feb 4)
```
Consensus: $1.29
Whisper:   $1.39 (+7.9%)
Signal:    🔴 AVOID vol-selling
Reason:    High surprise potential - beats by ~8% consistently
```

## Estimize Subscription

Nam signed up for Estimize Premium ($99/mo, 21-day trial):
- **Credentials saved:** `~/clawd/secrets/estimize.env`
- **Email:** namhbca@yahoo.com
- **Purpose:** Real whisper numbers for earnings trades

### Integration Status
- No public API at $99 tier (enterprise only = $$$$)
- Plan: Web scraping via Chrome relay
- Browser automation had port 18792 conflict - couldn't complete login

## Configuration Updates

### Browser Preference (TOOLS.md)
```
Default: Chrome Extension Relay (profile="chrome")
Only use clawd browser if Nam explicitly says otherwise
```

This is safer for logged-in sites (no bot detection risk).

## Technical Issues

Browser control server has persistent port 18792 conflict:
- Snapshot/navigate actions fail
- Tabs list works
- Need gateway restart to fix (not currently permitted)

## Browser Port Conflict Fix (AAR)

**Issue:** Browser snapshot/screenshot failed with `EADDRINUSE 127.0.0.1:18792`

**Root cause:** Gateway bound to 18792 for Chrome relay by default. Snapshot tried to reuse same port.

**Fix:** Added explicit browser profile config:
```json
"browser": {
  "profiles": {
    "clawd": { "cdpPort": 18800, "color": "#FF4500" },
    "chrome": { "cdpPort": 18803, "driver": "extension", "color": "#00AA00" }
  }
}
```

**Lesson:** When browser tools fail with port conflicts, check `browser.profiles` in config. Explicit ports prevent gateway conflicts.

## Estimize Skill Created

Created `~/clawd/skills/estimize/` with browser-based scraping workflow:
- Scrapes crowd consensus vs Wall St consensus
- Extracts historical accuracy data
- Provides trading signal interpretation
- Integrates with earnings-research flow

**Account:** namhbca@yahoo.com (Nam's Yahoo)
**Trial:** 21 days free, ends ~Feb 23
**Credentials saved:** ~/clawd/secrets/estimize.env
**Reminders set:** Feb 16 (first), Feb 17-23 (daily)

## Claude Chat History Import

Nam exported his Claude chat history. Processed into organized insight files:

### Files Created
```
~/clawd/knowledge/insights/
├── trading.md     # Earnings strategy, VRP, key learnings (93 lines)
├── health.md      # Biomarkers, supplements, genetic findings (111 lines)
├── preferences.md # Work style, design preferences, context (72 lines)
└── goals.md       # Health, trading, business goals (54 lines)
```

### Key Insights Extracted
- **Trading:** Earnings premium selling methodology, VRP strategy details, position sizing rules
- **Health:** Comprehensive biomarker profile, food sensitivities, supplement stack, peptide protocol
- **Preferences:** Ultra-direct communication, data-dense, action-oriented, night owl
- **Context:** Students Golf business, TMO investment ($1.5M), travel patterns

### Claude's Memory Categories
1. **conversations_memory** — General context about Nam
2. **project_memories** — 10+ detailed project contexts including:
   - Health optimization (peptides, biomarkers)
   - Earnings trading strategy
   - VRP trading strategy
   - Students Golf/SEO
   - DraftKings DFS
   - TMO investment
   - Automated trading (Alpaca)

**Source files:** `~/clawd/knowledge/chat-history/claude-raw/`

## Next Steps
- [ ] Import OpenAI/ChatGPT history (pending)
- [ ] Test skill with PYPL earnings research
- [ ] Integrate into earnings-research skill pipeline

## 🧠 Auto-Extracted Insights

**Preferences:**
- Wants **full data dumps** — "show all data, make it scannable"
- Prefers **Chrome Extension Relay** over clawd browser for logged-in sites (safer, no bot detection)
- Values **organized knowledge base** — spent entire evening importing Claude history into structured files
- Likes seeing **concrete progress** — confirmed satisfaction when I showed file counts and line totals

**Decisions:**
- Signed up for **Estimize Premium** ($99/mo, 21-day trial) for real whisper numbers
- Chose to use **browser scraping** vs waiting for API access (no public API at $99 tier)
- Agreed to **daily reminders** for Estimize trial ending (Feb 16 first, then daily Feb 17-23)
- Accepted **port conflict fix** via gateway config patch without hesitation

**Patterns:**
- Working **late night** (11:30 PM on a Sunday) — consistent with USER.md "night owl" description
- **Iterative building** — went from simple PYPL whisper calc → full Estimize skill → earnings research integration
- **Asks confirming questions** — "do you feel like you got it all?" after knowledge import

**Interests:**
- Deep dive into **Claude chat history** — 39 projects extracted, covering trading, health, poker, business
- Wants to correlate **health data with trading performance** (mentioned in extracted docs)
- Focus on **earnings trading edge** — whisper numbers, expected moves, IV crush

**Pain Points:**
- **Browser port 18792 conflict** blocked Estimize login attempt (couldn't complete integration)
- **No public API** at Estimize $99 tier was a surprise (would need enterprise for API access)

**Relationships:**
- Detailed project docs reference business partners: Michael Huynh (Students Golf), Tom (TMO), Chi Kan Tang (TMO co-investor)
- Follows traders: DannyTrades ($28.88/mo Patreon), MarketMaestro ($10/mo), Antonio Linares
- Mentioned Rocco Preston in old Claude conversations (contract/legal context)
