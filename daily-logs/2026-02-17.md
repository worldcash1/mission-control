## Polymarket Scanner — Yield Farming Filter Shipped
- Added yield farming filter to `alerts.ts`: skips bets at >95% or <5% implied probability
- Applies to `fresh_wallet_large_bet` and `whale_bet` alert types
- First clean scan: 0 false alerts (was generating dozens of noise alerts before)
- Committed to git

## Polymarket Scanner — Cron Fixed
- Cron was timing out (120s, 3 consecutive errors)
- Updated timeout to 180s, improved prompt, using prod Convex URL
- Cron ID: `5e7a1449-a268-4353-b736-d94993e9a62a`

## Polymarket Scanner — Data State
- 238,916 trades indexed in SQLite
- 11,926 wallet win rates calculated (from resolver)
- 6,427 active wallets (5+ trades)
- Only 2 wallets in `wallets` table (gap: resolver updates win rates but only for existing rows)
- 100 resolved markets synced
- 1,534 total alerts (most pre-filter noise)
- Convex prod: `valuable-wolf-662.convex.cloud` — 1K trades, ~1K alerts, 2 wallets synced

## Polymarket Scanner — Known Gaps
- Wallet table only has 2 entries despite 6,427 active wallets — scorer only upserts top 20 per scan cycle
- Need bulk wallet promotion: take wallets from trade_outcomes with good data and insert into wallets table
- Deep historical indexing needed for political/sports sharp detection
- Only 1 real sharp bettor found so far (esports specialist)

## Cron Consolidation & Cleanup
- Reduced from 58 → 48 cron jobs
- **Earnings capture:** 7 → 3 (morning pipeline shell script with sleep delays, midday, after-hours)
- **Social arb:** 4 → 1 (combined Bright Data MWF + Google Trends + TikTok + X Scanner into morning-pipeline.sh)
- **On-prem thesis:** 2 → 1 (Slack brief + Discord reminder merged)
- **Backups:** 2 → 1 (git + rsync in single systemEvent)
- **Estimize reminders:** 2 → 1 (removed trial reminder, kept monthly cancel)
- Downgraded 10 static reminder crons to haiku
- Updated 42 crons from sonnet-4.0/4.5 → sonnet-4-6
- Fixed 3 broken WhatsApp delivery → discord
- Polymarket Scanner: every 5min → every 6h, model → haiku
- New morning pipeline script: ~/projects/earnings-tracker/scripts/morning-pipeline.sh
- New social arb pipeline: ~/projects/social-arb/scripts/morning-pipeline.sh

## Cron State Summary (48 total)
- 28 sonnet-4-6 (blocked until OpenClaw update to 2026.2.17)
- 14 haiku, 3 systemEvent, 2 default, 1 disabled
- 8 more candidates identified for haiku downgrade (email-forward, btc-hood-alert, auto-close, weekly-memory-archive, hikma, ftx-claim, playtech-check, daily-ai-trends delete)
- OpenClaw update to 2026.2.17 approved but not yet executed — needed to unblock sonnet-4-6
