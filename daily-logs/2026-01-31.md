## Tokyo MMP Hotel Scan - April 2026

**Task:** Scan all 24 Marriott hotels in Tokyo area for MMP rates in April 2026

**Key Finding:** MMP rates DO work on some Tokyo hotels (contrary to initial concerns)

### Hotels Scanned (5/24 complete)
| Hotel | MMP Status | Best Rate | Best Date |
|-------|------------|-----------|-----------|
| Four Points Flex Shibuya (TYOSW) | ✅ YES | ¥20,700 (~$138) | Apr 21 |
| Prince Gallery (TYOLC) | ❌ No | - | Luxury Collection |
| Ritz-Carlton (TYORZ) | ❌ No | - | Ritz-Carlton |
| Westin Tokyo (TYOWI) | ✅ YES | ¥16,937 (~$113) | Apr 29, May 1 |
| Tokyo Marriott (TYOMC) | ✅ YES | ¥11,244 (~$75) | Apr 30, May 1 |

### Top Deals Found
1. **Tokyo Marriott** - ¥11,244/night (~$75!) on Apr 30 & May 1 — BEST DEAL
2. **Westin Tokyo** - ¥16,937/night (~$113) on Apr 29 & May 1
3. **Four Points Flex Shibuya** - ¥20,700/night (~$138) on Apr 21

### Pattern Discovered
- **Luxury hotels** (Ritz-Carlton, Prince Gallery, likely Bulgari) = No MMP participation
- **Mid-range hotels** (Marriott, Westin, Four Points, Courtyard) = MMP available
- **Best rates cluster around Golden Week** (late April/early May)

### Files Created
- `~/projects/marriott-scanner/data/tokyo-scan-interim.json` - Interim scan results
- `~/projects/marriott-scanner/scripts/tokyo-scan.js` - Hotel property codes list

### Sub-agent Spawned
- Label: `tokyo-mmp-scanner`
- Task: Complete full 24-hotel scan and generate PDF report
- Output: `~/projects/marriott-scanner/reports/tokyo-april-2026-mmp.pdf`

### ✅ SCAN COMPLETE (Night Shift Jan 31, 11am)
**All 24 hotels scanned!** 16 have MMP rates available.

#### Final Best Deals (sorted by price)
| Hotel | Best Rate | Best Date |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Four Points Flex Higashi Kanda | **¥5,844** (~$39) | Apr 30 |
| Four Points Flex Ueno | **¥5,846** (~$39) | Apr 23, 29, 30 |
| Four Points Flex Yokohama | **¥6,272** (~$42) | Apr 27 |
| Moxy Kinshicho | **¥8,113** (~$54) | Apr 29-30 |
| Yokohama Bay Sheraton | **¥9,821** (~$65) | Apr 24, 27 |
| Tokyo Marriott | **¥11,244** (~$75) | Apr 30 |
| Westin Yokohama | ¥14,710 (~$98) | Apr 22 |
| Sheraton Tokyo Bay (Disney) | ¥15,500 (~$103) | Apr 22, 27 |
| Westin Tokyo | ¥16,937 (~$113) | Apr 29 |

#### Pattern Confirmed
- Late April (27-30) = cheapest rates across all properties
- Golden Week spike (Apr 4-5, 11, 17-18) = avoid these dates
- $39-75 for quality hotels is exceptional for Tokyo

#### Files Generated
- `data/tokyo-april-2026-prices.json` — Full price matrix (16 hotels × 30 days)
- `reports/tokyo-april-2026-calendar.pdf` — Calendar view (1.7MB)
