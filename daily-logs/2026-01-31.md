## Tokyo MMP Hotel Scan - April 2026

**Task:** Scan all 24 Marriott hotels in Tokyo area for MMP rates in April 2026

**Key Finding:** MMP rates DO work on some Tokyo hotels (contrary to initial concerns)

### Hotels Scanned (5/24 complete)
| Hotel | MMP Status | Best Rate | Best Date |
|-------|------------|-----------|-----------|
| Four Points Flex Shibuya (TYOSW) | ✅ YES | ¥20,700 (~$138) | Apr 21 |
| Prince Gallery (TYOLC) | ❌ No | - | Luxury Collection |
| Ritz-Carlton (TYORZ) | ❌ No | - | Ritz-Carlton |
| Westin Tokyo (TYOWI) | ✅ YES | ¥16,937 (~$113) | Apr 29, May 1 |
| Tokyo Marriott (TYOMC) | ✅ YES | ¥11,244 (~$75) | Apr 30, May 1 |

### Top Deals Found
1. **Tokyo Marriott** - ¥11,244/night (~$75!) on Apr 30 & May 1 — BEST DEAL
2. **Westin Tokyo** - ¥16,937/night (~$113) on Apr 29 & May 1
3. **Four Points Flex Shibuya** - ¥20,700/night (~$138) on Apr 21

### Pattern Discovered
- **Luxury hotels** (Ritz-Carlton, Prince Gallery, likely Bulgari) = No MMP participation
- **Mid-range hotels** (Marriott, Westin, Four Points, Courtyard) = MMP available
- **Best rates cluster around Golden Week** (late April/early May)

### Files Created
- `~/projects/marriott-scanner/data/tokyo-scan-interim.json` - Interim scan results
- `~/projects/marriott-scanner/scripts/tokyo-scan.js` - Hotel property codes list

### Sub-agent Spawned
- Label: `tokyo-mmp-scanner`
- Task: Complete full 24-hotel scan and generate PDF report
- Output: `~/projects/marriott-scanner/reports/tokyo-april-2026-mmp.pdf`
