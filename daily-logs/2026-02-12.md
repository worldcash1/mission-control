## Daily Summary
- Overnight cron ops ran smoothly: backups, Schwab token refreshes, local rsync, API health checks
- API health check: 6/9 services green, 3 warnings (Alpha Vantage & Finnhub on demo keys, OQuants 404)
- Nam flagged **TBPH** (Theravance Biopharma) as potential short — near 52W high ($19.29), P/E 33.84, small cap $977M
- Duplicate cron triggers observed multiple times — may want to investigate scheduling overlap

## Connect Keeper V2 Work
- **Repo:** /Users/clawd/projects/connect-keeper-v2
- **DB:** Neon Postgres (connection string in .env.local)
- **Hosting:** Vercel (auto-deploys on push to main)
- **Compact header refactor:** Merged title + stats + tabs into row 1, search + filters + sort into row 2. Saved ~120px vertical space. Committed.
- **Profile card refactor:** Removed TikTok everywhere. Added phone, age, profile_url, message_url fields (DB columns already existed). Card now shows contact icons + tags always visible (no hover-only). Committed.
- **Location cleanup (done):** Normalized ~160 profiles down to 19 clean cities. Added autocomplete + auto-title-case to form. Script at scripts/fix-locations.mjs.
- **Card content fix:** Gradient h-32→h-40, tighter padding so always-visible contacts don't clip at bottom.
- **DB has unused columns:** conversation_summary, seeking_uid — not wired to frontend yet
- **Card aspect ratio:** CrossfadeImage uses aspect-[3/4]
