# 2026-02-05 | Earnings Intel System Built

## 🔥 Major Project: Coiled Earnings Scanner

Built complete squeeze detection system for Nam's earnings trading strategy.

### Core Concept
Find stocks where:
- High short interest (SI 15%+)
- Low expectations (Estimize gap negative)
- Technical oversold
- Shorts positioned wrong → beat triggers squeeze

### Scanner Evolution
- **v1**: Basic SI + DTC + Estimize gap
- **v2**: Added insider buying, RSI, price compression
- **v3**: Added Reddit/WSB sentiment, Google News, short volume trend

### 9 Signals Now Active
| Signal | Weight | Source |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Short Interest | 20% | Finviz |
| Estimize Gap | 18% | Estimize scrape |
| Insider Activity | 12% | OpenInsider |
| Reddit Sentiment | 10% | Reddit API |
| Technical Setup | 10% | Yahoo Finance |
| Options Skew | 10% | Schwab API |
| Days to Cover | 8% | Finviz |
| News Momentum | 7% | Google News |
| Short Volume | 5% | Finra |

### Convex Database
- **URL**: https://dazzling-dogfish-586.convex.cloud
- **Tables**: squeezes (candidates + outcomes)
- **Purpose**: Track predictions vs reality for backtesting

### Candidates Tracked (First Batch)
| Ticker | Score | Earnings | Key Setup |
|--------|-------|----------|-----------|
| AFRM | 6.8 | Feb 6 (tomorrow!) | First test case |
| UPST | 7.0 | Feb 11 | Cleanest setup |
| CVNA | 6.5 | Feb 19 | Insiders selling ⚠️ |
| RIVN | 5.0 | Feb 20 | Avoid - insider dump |
| BYND | 7.9 | Feb 26 | Highest score, penny stock |

### Cron Jobs Added
- `squeeze-outcome-tracker` - 7 AM daily, records results
- `coiled-earnings-weekly` - Sundays 6 PM, full scan
- `afrm-earnings-alert` - Tomorrow 1 PM, one-time reminder

### Key Trading Concepts Explained to Nam
- **SI (Short Interest)**: % of float sold short. Higher = more squeeze fuel
- **Gap**: Estimize vs Wall Street difference. NEGATIVE = low bar = good
- **Strategy**: Not predicting earnings, finding asymmetric risk/reward where crowd is wrong

- Calculated points transfer: 18,000 Amex MR → 14,400 Emirates miles needed

### AgentMail Fix
- Fixed API auth issue - was using `x-api-key` instead of `Authorization: Bearer`
- API working fine: 64 messages in inbox

### Cron Issues Identified
- Recurring error: "model not allowed: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514"
