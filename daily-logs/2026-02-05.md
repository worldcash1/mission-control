# 2026-02-05 | Earnings Intel System Built

## 🔥 Major Project: Coiled Earnings Scanner

Built complete squeeze detection system for Nam's earnings trading strategy.

### Core Concept
Find stocks where:
- High short interest (SI 15%+)
- Low expectations (Estimize gap negative)
- Technical oversold
- Shorts positioned wrong → beat triggers squeeze

### Scanner Evolution
- **v1**: Basic SI + DTC + Estimize gap
- **v2**: Added insider buying, RSI, price compression
- **v3**: Added Reddit/WSB sentiment, Google News, short volume trend

### 9 Signals Now Active
| Signal | Weight | Source |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Short Interest | 20% | Finviz |
| Estimize Gap | 18% | Estimize scrape |
| Insider Activity | 12% | OpenInsider |
| Reddit Sentiment | 10% | Reddit API |
| Technical Setup | 10% | Yahoo Finance |
| Options Skew | 10% | Schwab API |
| Days to Cover | 8% | Finviz |
| News Momentum | 7% | Google News |
| Short Volume | 5% | Finra |

### Convex Database
- **URL**: https://dazzling-dogfish-586.convex.cloud
- **Tables**: squeezes (candidates + outcomes)
- **Purpose**: Track predictions vs reality for backtesting

### Candidates Tracked (First Batch)
| Ticker | Score | Earnings | Key Setup |
|--------|-------|----------|-----------|
| AFRM | 6.8 | Feb 6 (tomorrow!) | First test case |
| UPST | 7.0 | Feb 11 | Cleanest setup |
| CVNA | 6.5 | Feb 19 | Insiders selling ⚠️ |
| RIVN | 5.0 | Feb 20 | Avoid - insider dump |
| BYND | 7.9 | Feb 26 | Highest score, penny stock |

### Cron Jobs Added
- `squeeze-outcome-tracker` - 7 AM daily, records results
- `coiled-earnings-weekly` - Sundays 6 PM, full scan
- `afrm-earnings-alert` - Tomorrow 1 PM, one-time reminder

### Key Trading Concepts Explained to Nam
- **SI (Short Interest)**: % of float sold short. Higher = more squeeze fuel
- **Gap**: Estimize vs Wall Street difference. NEGATIVE = low bar = good
- **Strategy**: Not predicting earnings, finding asymmetric risk/reward where crowd is wrong

### Files Created
- `~/clawd/skills/coiled-scanner/scripts/scan_v2.py`
- `~/clawd/skills/coiled-scanner/scripts/scan_v3.py`
- `~/clawd/skills/coiled-scanner/scripts/data_sources.py`
- `~/projects/earnings-intel/scripts/track-candidates.ts`

### Discord Channel
- **#📊-earnings-intel**: 1468416625249091749
- Posted first scan results with 7 candidates

### Future Upgrades Identified
- Ortex ($99/mo) - real-time SI + cost to borrow
- More Reddit subs (r/stocks, r/options)
- StockTwits sentiment
- Full Estimize API

---

## Nam Context
- Currently in Dubai (flew HKG→DXB today)
- Teaching him the squeeze strategy concepts
- First tracked outcome: AFRM tomorrow after close

---

## Evening/Night Session (PST)

### Flight & Travel
- Nam asked about HKG→DXB flight (6:05pm departure) - couldn't match to Emirates schedule
- Calculated points transfer: 18,000 Amex MR → 14,400 Emirates miles needed

### AgentMail Fix
- Fixed API auth issue - was using `x-api-key` instead of `Authorization: Bearer`
- API working fine: 64 messages in inbox

### Cron Issues Identified
- Recurring error: "model not allowed: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514"
- Affects: Playtech checks, Trading Morning Brief
- **TODO**: Update those cron jobs to use valid model alias
- Brave Search rate limited (429) - hit 1 req/sec on free plan

### Earnings Crons Running
- ✅ Estimize intel posted to Discord (AMZN, SHOP, BABA findings)
- ✅ Earnings scan: 18 stocks with weekly options found

### System Health
- Schwab token refresh: Running every 25 min ✅
- Auto-backup: Running hourly ✅

### High Short Interest Research
Compiled squeeze candidate list by cross-referencing SI data with earnings:

| Ticker | SI% | DTC | Earnings | Notes |
|--------|-----|-----|----------|-------|
| HTZ | 44.57% | ? | ? | Highest SI on list |
| GRPN | 44.06% | ? | ? | Second highest |
| IOVA | 35.71% | ? | ? | Biotech |
| AI | 34.61% | ? | ? | Software |
| HIMS | 32.22% | ? | ? | Healthcare |
| SOUN | 30.23% | ? | Feb 26 | AI play |
| BYND | 30.45% | 2.23 | Feb 25 | ±41.78% expected move |
| UPST | 26.49% | 4.8 | **Feb 10** | ±15.82% expected move |
| AFRM | 5.52% | 3.11 | **TODAY** | Low SI, not squeeze play |

**Best Squeeze Candidates:**
1. **UPST** - 26.49% SI, Feb 10 earnings, highest quality setup
2. **SOUN** - 30.23% SI, Feb 26 earnings
3. **BYND** - 30.45% SI, Feb 25 earnings, massive expected move

### Issues Found
1. **Schwab Token Expired** - 7-day refresh token limit hit, needs manual re-auth
2. **Marriott Scanner Blocked** - Bot detection ("Access Denied"), stealth mode failed
3. **Brave Search Rate Limited** - Hit 1 req/sec limit

### Marriott Scanner Debug
- Tested both plain puppeteer and playwright-extra with stealth
- Both get "Access Denied" from Marriott
- **Root cause:** Even stealth plugins don't bypass Marriott's detection
- **Fix required:** Browser relay with human login (Brave + Chrome extension)
- **Lesson added to lessons.md:** Marriott needs relay, not headless

### Data Sources Working
- StatMuse for short interest data ✅
- Web fetch for market news ✅
- Earnings dates from TipRanks/WallStreetHorizon ✅

### Data Sources Blocked
- Fintel (Cloudflare)
- MarketBeat (Cloudflare)
- Nasdaq short interest (data not available)
- Benzinga content (paywall)

### 💡 5 Project Ideas for Nam

1. **SI + Earnings Cross-Referencer** 🔥
   - Auto-scan high SI stocks against earnings calendar
   - Alert when high SI stock approaches earnings
   - Build time: 4-6 hours
   - Value: Automates the manual research I just did

2. **Sector Rotation Dashboard** ⭐
   - Track money flow between sectors (tech → value → energy)
   - Show relative strength by sector with trend arrows
   - Build time: 8-12 hours (needs ETF data)
   - Value: Spot rotation early

3. **Sleep → Trading Performance Correlator** 🔥
   - Link Oura sleep scores to trade outcomes
   - Track: sleep quality, HRV, and P&L correlation
   - Build time: 6-8 hours (data already in Convex + Oura)
   - Value: Quantify if sleep affects trading decisions

4. **Expected Move Calculator** ⭐
   - Use ATM straddle pricing to show implied moves pre-earnings
   - Compare historical implied vs actual moves
   - Build time: 4-6 hours (Schwab API has this data)
   - Value: Size positions correctly for earnings

5. **Watchlist Health Monitor** 💡
   - Daily digest of changes in key metrics for tracked stocks
   - SI changes, insider activity, analyst revisions
   - Build time: 6-8 hours
   - Value: Stay on top of thesis changes

**Recommendations:**
- Start with #1 (SI + Earnings) - directly extends coiled scanner
- #3 (Sleep correlation) is easy since data exists, high personal value

### Deliverables Created

## 🎰 IREN Earnings Trade — LIVE SESSION

**Time:** 3:00 AM - 1:00 PM PT
**Earnings:** After close (~2 PM PT)

### Nam's Final Position (~$1M total exposure)
- **Shares:** 10,000+ shares @ ~$40 avg (~$400K)
- **Feb 6 $45 Calls:** 115 contracts
- **Feb 6 $50 Calls:** 300 contracts  
- **Feb 6 $55 Calls:** 600 contracts (LOTTO)

### Price Action Today
- Open: ~$44
- Low: $39.72
- Close: ~$40
- **Down 11% on earnings day**

### The Thesis
- **Bull case:** New hyperscaler deal (Amazon/Meta) = +50-100%
- **Bear case:** No deal = -20-30%
- **Binary outcome** — all Feb 6 OTM calls go to $0 if no deal

### Key Strategy Insights
1. ATM calls > shares for deal thesis (6-8x better ROI)
2. $55 calls = max ROI lotto (2,500%+ if $65)
3. Liquidity matters — stick to high OI strikes
4. Lower price = cheaper calls = better entry for binary bet
5. Feb 6 weeklies better than Feb 13 (no extra theta)

### Sentiment Analysis
- **X/Twitter:** High deal expectations among bulls
- **Wall Street:** LOW - expecting loss (-$0.10 EPS)
- **Price action:** Bearish (-11% today) = good for contrarian

### Schwab API Issue
- Refresh token expired (7-day limit)
- Needs manual OAuth re-auth
- Used screenshots from Nam for live data

### Outcome: TBD
Earnings releasing now — will track result for coiled scanner learning
