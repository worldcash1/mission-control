# 2026-01-29 - Night Shift Log

## 🌙 Night Shift Started: 11:00 PM PT

### Task 1: Marriott Scanner Skill
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE (with limitations)

**What was built:**
- Full Playwright-based scanner script at `~/clawd/skills/marriott-scanner/scripts/scan.py`
- Virtual environment with dependencies (playwright, playwright-stealth)
- Curated database of 80+ Marriott hotels across 9 major cities

**Challenge encountered:**
- Marriott.com uses Akamai bot protection that blocks automated scraping
- Multiple approaches tried:
  1. Standard Playwright automation - blocked after search
  2. Playwright with stealth mode - still blocked
  3. Persistent browser context - blocked
  4. Direct URL with promo code - blocked

**Solution implemented:**
- Pivoted to a practical link generator approach
- Database of hotel codes for major cities (HK, Tokyo, Singapore, Bangkok, NYC, LA, London, Paris, Dubai)
- Generates HTML report with clickable booking links
- MMP promo code automatically applied to all links
- Quick search form for custom city/date queries

**How to use:**
```bash
cd ~/clawd/skills/marriott-scanner
./venv/bin/python3 scripts/scan.py --city "Hong Kong" --months "Feb,Mar"
# Opens marriott-hong-kong-YYYYMMDD.html with clickable MMP links
```

**Cities available:**
- Hong Kong (10 hotels)
- Tokyo (9 hotels)
- Singapore (8 hotels)
- Bangkok (8 hotels)
- New York (10 hotels)
- Los Angeles (7 hotels)
- London (9 hotels)
- Paris (7 hotels)
- Dubai (8 hotels)

**Future improvements needed:**
- Add more cities on request
- Consider using a residential proxy service to bypass Akamai
- Could try browser extension approach (user clicks, extension captures prices)

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

1. **Marriott bot protection is aggressive** - Akamai blocks even stealth browsers
2. **Sometimes the best automation is semi-automation** - Generate links humans can click
3. **Curated databases can be valuable** - Hotel codes enable direct booking URLs

## 🎯 Trading Implications

1. **Tech Rotation Underway** - Money moving out of high-capex AI plays
2. **VIX Spike** - Increased volatility, options pricing up
3. **Energy Play** - Oil up on Iran tensions, may continue
4. **Copper Surge** - +4.85% suggests industrial demand / China recovery?
5. **Watch AAPL** - After-hours earnings could set tone for Friday

**Potential Plays:**
- 🔴 Avoid: Software names (NOW, CRM, ADBE) until dust settles
- 🟢 Consider: Energy (XLE), industrials if tech continues weak
- 🟡 Neutral: AAPL - wait for earnings reaction
