## Overnight Maintenance (04:00-07:00 PST)

### Schwab Token Expired ⚠️
- **04:00:** Refresh token failed with `refresh_token_authentication_error`
- Root cause: Refresh token has expired (typically 7-day lifespan)
- **Action needed:** Nam needs to run full OAuth flow to re-authenticate
- Skipped subsequent refresh attempts (known broken state)

### Automated Backups ✅
- Git backups ran hourly — no workspace changes to commit
- Local rsync backups to ~/Documents/alfred-backup/ — 134 files synced successfully

### Error Monitoring ✅
- #errors channel checked regularly — all clear, no app errors

### Cron Issue Noted
- 07:00: A cron job failed with "model not allowed: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4"
- Needs investigation — may be a model access policy issue

## Pending Items
- [ ] Schwab OAuth re-authentication (blocked for trading features)
- [ ] Investigate cron model access error

## Nam's Location
- Dubai (7 PM local when this was written)
