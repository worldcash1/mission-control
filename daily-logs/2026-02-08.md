## OQuants Pre-Earnings Snapshot System
- `~/bin/oquants-snapshot` — captures 18 API endpoints per ticker pre-earnings
- Key discovery: `/earnings/returns` (real earnings backtest) vs `/volatility/backtest` (rolling 30d, misleading)
- 2 directional endpoints don't work via API (server-rendered only)
- Cron: 3 PM ET daily, posts to #earnings-tracker
- Data: `~/data/oquants/snapshots/YYYY-MM-DD/TICKER/`

## schwab-trades CLI — Major Fixes
- Added `positionEffect` tracking (OPENING/CLOSING from API)
- Structure detection from all legs (including expired wings)
- Ghost trade filtering, strategy auto-tagging
- Results (21-day, 54 trades): 62% WR, +$356 net
- Earnings Vol-Sell: 17W/10L (63%), basically breakeven
