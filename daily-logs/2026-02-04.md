### 5 Project Ideas (Full Details)
See: `memory/morning-ideas-2026-02-04.md`

**Top 3 Recommendations:**
1. 🔥 Sleep-to-Trading Correlator — Quantify sleep→performance link
2. 🔥 Earnings Decision Engine — One-click GO/NO-GO with structure recommendation  
3. 📧 Email-to-Task Pipeline — Auto-extract action items from Gmail

### Sleep-Trading Correlator Built! 🎉

Created working POC at: `~/clawd/tools/sleep-trader-correlator/`

**How it works:**
1. Fetches Oura sleep data (sleep score, HRV, deep sleep, etc.)
2. Loads trading P&L from CSV (or future Schwab integration)
3. Correlates and generates insights

**Sample Output:**
```
High Sleep (score ≥75): 100% win rate
Low Sleep (score <75):  50% win rate
→ Sleep quality matters: 100% win rate on good sleep vs 50% on poor sleep
```

**Usage:**
```bash
cd ~/clawd/tools/sleep-trader-correlator
python3 scripts/correlate.py --days 30
```

**Files created:**
- `scripts/fetch_oura.py` - Oura API data fetcher
- `scripts/correlate.py` - Main correlation analysis
- `data/trading_log.csv` - Trading P&L input (manual for now)
- `reports/` - Generated analysis reports

**Next steps to productionize:**
1. Add Schwab account API for automatic P&L import
2. Create web dashboard (Mission Control integration?)
3. Set up weekly email digest

### Dubai MMP Scan Bonus 🏨

- Feb 13-14: AED 923-960 (~$251-261/night)
- **Feb 15-16: AED 382 (~$104/night)** 🔥🔥🔥

That's a 5-star hotel for $104/night! Insane MMP value.

## 🧠 Auto-Extracted Insights

**Preferences:**
- Wants proactive market updates during volatility ("blood on the streets" → expects immediate analysis)
- Values "exact duplicate" setups when migrating machines — all CLIs, configs, everything
- Prefers simple hardware solutions over complex workarounds (bought keyboard + HDMI vs ethernet sharing)
- Likes thread-per-topic organization in Discord (deep dives on AMD, SMCI)
- Wants bid/ask spread averaging (ATM + above + below) for earnings options analysis

**Decisions:**
- Chose to leave iMac in HK office and migrate to new CA machine later
- Will use Time Machine + incremental sync approach for migration (CCC for bootable backup)
- Bought cheap keyboard + HDMI for hotel WiFi captive portal access
- Prioritized earnings scanner enhancements: Estimize integration, notes feature, spread averaging

**Patterns:**
- Checks market status during high volatility periods (multiple touchpoints: 7am, 10am, 10am questions)
- Asks "dip buying" questions during selloffs — opportunistic trading mindset
- Travel logistics research happens in bursts (WiFi setup, migration planning in same session)
- Links processing sessions are deep and thorough — processes many URLs in sequence

**Interests:**
- AI/Clawdbot ecosystem news (interviews, security releases, workflow patterns)
- Trading automation (earnings scanners, Estimize crowd estimates, sentiment analysis)
- System migration/portability (values not losing work when moving machines)
- Travel hacking (Marriott MMP rates, award flight tracking)

**Pain Points:**
- Market uncertainty during selloffs — wants clearer guidance on value levels
- Migration complexity — concerned about losing CLI tools, configs in transfer
- Captive portal WiFi at hotels — friction for headless Mac setup

**Relationships:**
- Building tools for friend Tom (Gmail search app)
- Following specific trading personalities: MarketMaestro, DannyTrades, THT methodology
- Interested in Polymarket (asked about API) — potential future integration
