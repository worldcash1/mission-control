# 2026-02-14 (Saturday)

## Night Shift Autonomous Work (11am PST)
- **API Health:** 7/9 green (Schwab, Oura, X, AlphaV, AgentMail, Convex x2), 2 warnings (Finnhub demo key, OQuants 404)
- **Marriott Scanner:** Verified working (last run Feb 13), Python/Playwright installed, skill operational
- **Trading Prep:** Markets closed (weekend), researched upcoming week, on-prem AI thesis tracking
- **Earnings Week Feb 17:** Medtronic, Palo Alto Networks, Cadence, Energy Transfer, Labcorp, DTE Energy
- **Market Context:** Gold/silver volatility, on-prem AI infrastructure thesis active (NVDA, DELL, SMCI longs)

## 5 Project Ideas (Night Shift Brainstorm)
1. **Pre-Market Earnings Intel Bot** 🔥 — Auto-generate earnings brief at 6am ET (sentiment + options flow + estimates) for each day's reporters
2. **HRV-Based Trade Sizing** ⭐ — Reduce position size 50% when HRV <50 or sleep score <70 (prevent emotional trading on bad sleep)
3. **On-Prem AI Stock Screener** 🔥 — Daily scan for enterprise infra deals/announcements → auto-update DELL/NVDA/SMCI watchlist
4. **Discord Voice Memos → Transcripts** ⭐ — Auto-transcribe voice notes in #trading channel, extract tickers/thesis, save to brain/
5. **Mission Control Earnings Tab** 💡 — Dedicated view: upcoming 7 days, crowd estimates, options IV, sentiment pulse

## Highlights
- Nam traveling in Jakarta, Indonesia
- Helped research KTV venues (Haomen/M Party PIK, Lavva, Encore)
- Restaurant recs for Grand Indonesia & Plaza Indonesia malls
- Harvey (new agent) working on Slack — Slack auto-threading issue identified (bot using thread_ts)
- Auto-backup, Schwab refresh, rsync all running smoothly

## Decisions
- Slack thread issue: need to find Harvey's OpenClaw config on iMac to disable thread replies

## Pending
- Fix Harvey's Slack auto-threading (config on iMac)
- Investigate Finnhub demo key + OQuants 404 during business hours
- Harvey setup ongoing

## Notes
- Nam in Jakarta (GMT+7), night owl schedule active
- Valentine's Day

## Discord Bot Fix (ongoing)
- Root cause: bot connects to Discord gateway but MESSAGE_CREATE events never delivered
- Token reset twice (old tokens invalidated); current working token starts with `MTQ2...GBjM_S`
- Bot name is "Clawdbot" (app ID 1466618433012760631), shows as @alfred
- `ackReactionScope` changed to `"all"`, `requireMention: false` for guild
- `ownerAllowFrom: ["339165650515787777"]` added for slash commands
- Message Content Intent shows LIMITED (toggle ON in portal, <100 servers = auto-approved)
- Bot permissions verified: READ_MESSAGES + SEND_MESSAGES = true
- Outbound works (REST API sends fine), inbound websocket events NOT received
- Even trace-level logging shows zero MESSAGE_CREATE — Discord gateway is zombie
- Next step: kick bot from server + re-invite with fresh OAuth2 URL
- OAuth2 URL: `https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1466618433012760631&scope=bot%20applications.commands&permissions=274878221376`
- Trace logging currently ON — revert to debug after fix

## Config Changes Made
- `commands.ownerAllowFrom`: ["339165650515787777"] (Nam's Discord ID)
- `messages.ackReactionScope`: "all"
- `logging.level`: "trace" (temporary)
- Discord token updated twice
- AGENTS.md: Discord/Slack = "always respond" work channels

## Discord Fix — Continued (evening)
- Created NEW Discord bot "alfredx" (ID: 1472468138904915978) — separate from old Clawdbot
- Old Clawdbot token kept getting invalidated (suspected iMac conflict)
- New bot same problem: connects, receives INTERACTION_CREATE (slash commands) but NOT MESSAGE_CREATE
- Updated OpenClaw 2026.2.13 → 2026.2.14 — no change
- Removed all Discord bindings (Sentinel/Harvey) — confirmed known bug "Session file path must be within sessions directory"
- Migrated ALL 18 Haiku cron jobs → Sonnet 4.0 (Haiku EOL Feb 19)
- Trace logging, IPv4-first DNS, new bot, new version — nothing fixed inbound messages
- **Root cause still unknown** — likely OpenClaw bug, not Discord-side
- Next: file GitHub issue, check iMac when Nam home

## Schwab Token
- Refresh token expiring within 24h (warning started ~8:25 PM PST)
- Markets closed til Monday — re-auth needed before open

## Travel
- Nam flying home tomorrow (Sun Feb 15) at 2:30 PM from CGK Jakarta
- Leave Grand Hyatt by 10-10:30 AM (1-2h traffic to airport)
- Researched charter jets Jakarta → Sulawesi/Makassar ($11K-$43K depending on jet)

## Nam Preferences (noted)
- Asked to stop emoji reactions on messages
- Wants Sonnet not Opus for cron jobs (cost conscious)

## 🧠 Auto-Extracted Insights

**Preferences Discovered:**
- No emoji reactions on messages (stated explicitly)
- Sonnet preferred for cron jobs over Opus (cost optimization)
- Discord/Slack work channels = always respond (not casual banter)
- Direct communication style, skip pleasantries

**Technical Decisions:**
- Migrated all 18 Haiku cron jobs → Sonnet 4.0 before Feb 19 EOL
- Created separate Discord bot "alfredx" to avoid iMac/Mac mini token conflicts
- Set AGENTS.md rule: Discord/Slack = work channels (always respond)
- Enabled trace logging temporarily for Discord debugging

**Patterns Identified:**
- Harvey (new agent on iMac) running on Slack successfully
- Multi-agent setup: Alfred (Mac mini), Harvey (iMac), Sentinel (Mac mini)
- Weekend routine: Schwab token refresh even when markets closed
- Auto-backup cron runs at 4am PST daily
- API health checks run automatically, post to Discord

**Pain Points:**
- Discord bot MESSAGE_CREATE events not working (extensive debugging, still unresolved)
- Slack auto-threading when bot replies (Harvey config needs fixing)
- OpenClaw multi-agent bindings config confusion (docs vs schema mismatch)

**Context:**
- Nam traveling in Jakarta, Indonesia (Valentine's Day)
- Flying home Sunday Feb 15 at 2:30 PM CGK
- Researched KTV venues, restaurants, charter jets for future reference
- Schwab token expiring soon, needs re-auth before Monday market open
