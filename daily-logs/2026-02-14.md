# 2026-02-14 (Friday/Saturday)

## Highlights
- Nam traveling in Jakarta, Indonesia
- Helped research KTV venues (Haomen/M Party PIK, Lavva, Encore)
- Restaurant recs for Grand Indonesia & Plaza Indonesia malls
- Harvey (new agent) working on Slack — Slack auto-threading issue identified (bot using thread_ts)
- Auto-backup, Schwab refresh, rsync all running smoothly
- API health check: all critical APIs up, minor warnings (Finnhub demo key, OQuants 404)

## Decisions
- Slack thread issue: need to find Harvey's OpenClaw config on iMac to disable thread replies

## Pending
- Fix Harvey's Slack auto-threading (config on iMac)
- Investigate Finnhub demo key + OQuants 404 during business hours
- Harvey setup ongoing

## Notes
