## VisionClaw — Glasses + OpenClaw Vision (Feb 12)
- Meta Ray-Ban + OpenClaw vision: github.com/sseanliu/VisionClaw
- Cannabis use cases: cultivation logging, inventory walks, sales reps (highest ROI), METRC compliance

## Trade Journal Plugin — BUILT ✅
- `~/clawd/brain/.obsidian/plugins/trade-journal/` — calendar heatmap, Convex integration, mock data

## Major Architecture Decision: Obsidian Plugins → DROPPED
- No real advantage building plugins inside Obsidian — limited UI, tied to one machine
- **Mission Control web app is the new home** for all dashboards and project management
- Obsidian = just local markdown storage (notes, SOPs, research). No plugins needed.

## Three-Tier Data Architecture
- **Hot (memory/):** Tiny, pointers only. 7 days of concise daily files (~15-25 lines each)
- **Warm (Convex):** Structured queryable data (trades, earnings, health, projects)
- **Cold (brain/):** Long-form knowledge, research, SOPs, archived logs. Read on demand.

## Memory Cleanup — DONE
- Compressed 8 daily files: 1,408 lines → 242 lines (83% reduction)
- Moved to brain/: transcripts (4.1MB), patterns (10 docs), workflows (9 docs), full daily backups
- Nothing deleted — everything in brain/daily-logs/, brain/guides/, brain/transcripts/

## Mission Control — New Vision
- **Project hub with tags** (not strict categories) — finance, cannabis, work, family, side quests
- Every project has a status: 🔬 Research → 📐 Planning → 🚧 Building → ✅ Live → ⏸️ Paused → 📦 Archived
- **Document viewer:** upload PDFs/spreadsheets per project, view inline, expand, edit, delete
- **Two-way:** edit/delete in UI → updates actual files on disk
- Nickel mine = a project (status: Research), not a separate "research" folder
- Standard process: new project → Discord channel + GitHub repo (if code) + Convex (if DB) + register in Mission Control

## All Projects Inventoried (19 total)
- Active (code+channel): Mission Control, Earnings Tracker, Marriott Scanner, Scout, Connect Keeper, GrowWatch, Social Arb, Jordi Vissor, DailyLingo
- Research/Ideas: Nickel Mining, AI Trading Firm, Culture Cultivation, Ponderosa Court, Flight Hunter
- Archive: Trade Tracker v1/v2, Cannabis Wholesale Portal, Virtual AI Studio, Kirby Distro

## Agent Architecture — Lean Routing
- Alfred = COO/router with tiny MEMORY.md (routing table, not data storage)
- Each agent gets: tiny memory, own Convex tables, own brain/ subfolder, Discord channels
- Future agents: Builder (CTO), Legal, Health
- When asked something → answer or route to right agent

## Obsidian Plugins Gameplan Updated
- Renamed to Mission Control gameplan at `~/clawd/projects/obsidian-plugins/GAMEPLAN.md`
- Discord channel: #🧩-obsidian-plugins (1471813905436246038)

## #links Channel Workflow
- Auto-create threads for every link posted in #🔗-links — don't skip

## CPI Report — January 2026 (Released Feb 13)
- Headline: +0.2% MoM, 2.4% YoY (beat consensus 0.3%/2.5%)
- Core: +0.3% MoM, 2.4% YoY (below 2.5% expected, down from 2.6%)
- Shelter cooling to +0.2% MoM (was 0.4%) — big deal
- Energy -1.5%, gasoline -3.2%, used cars -1.8%
- Market reaction muted: futures -0.2%, 10Y ~4.10%
- Pre-tariff data — last clean CPI before tariff impact hits
- Bullish for rate-sensitive plays, summer rate cut more likely

## Blood Type Discussion
- Nam asked about blood types — don't have his on file
- Not in any saved health reports (Function Health, Thorne, Bumrungrad)
- Need to find from hospital records

## Cron Duplicate Issue
- Backup + Schwab refresh crons firing 10+ duplicate triggers per cycle
- Flagged to Nam — needs dedup

## Market Context (Feb 13 Pre-Open)
- Yesterday: S&P -1.57%, Nasdaq -2.03%, Dow -1.34% — AI disruption fear selloff
- AppLovin -20%, trucking/logistics hammered
- VIX at 20.82, elevated
- CPI beat not enough to overcome AI rotation panic
- July rate cut now being priced in
- Advised Nam: de-risk but don't fully exit, raise cash 20-30%, watch March CPI (Mar 12)

## Session Summary
- 4am-7am: Mostly cron maintenance (backups, Schwab refreshes, heartbeats)
- Nam active 5:10-5:50am: CPI preview → CPI results → market insights → tariff/exit strategy
- Educational: blood type deep dive (types, compatibility, evolution, pros/cons, global distribution)
- Key advice: partial de-risk, not full exit; tariffs not fully priced in; March/April CPI likely hotter
