## 💡 Morning Summary: 5 Project Ideas

### 1. 🔥 Trade Journal Auto-Logger
**What:** Automatically log every trade from Schwab API to a structured database with entry/exit prices, P&L, hold time, and strategy tags.
**Why:** Manual trade journaling is tedious but critical for learning. Auto-capture means perfect records without effort.
**Build time:** 4-6 hours
**Priority:** 🔥 HIGH - Direct trading improvement

### 2. 🔥 Sleep Score → Trading Performance Correlator
**What:** Combine Oura sleep data with daily trading P&L to find correlations. Alert when sleep score predicts poor decision-making.
**Why:** Bad sleep = bad trades. Quantify the relationship and get warned before market open.
**Build time:** 3-4 hours
**Priority:** 🔥 HIGH - Health + trading intersection

### 3. ⭐ Options Premium Decay Dashboard
**What:** Track theta decay on open positions in real-time. Show "time value burned today" and optimal exit windows.
**Why:** Premium selling strategies need decay visibility. Know exactly when to close.
**Build time:** 6-8 hours (needs Schwab options chain data)
**Priority:** ⭐ MEDIUM - Trading enhancement

### 4. ⭐ Email-to-Action Pipeline
**What:** Scan incoming emails for actionable items (bills, appointments, deadlines) and auto-create tasks/calendar events.
**Why:** Email is a black hole of todos. Extract action items automatically.
**Build time:** 4-5 hours
**Priority:** ⭐ MEDIUM - Automation/productivity

### 5. 💡 Price Alert Aggregator
**What:** Unified price monitoring for stocks, flights, hotels (like MMP), crypto. One dashboard, one alert system.
**Why:** Currently scattered across apps. Consolidate all "notify me when X reaches Y" in one place.
**Build time:** 8-10 hours
**Priority:** 💡 NICE-TO-HAVE - Convenience

**Recommendation:** Start with #1 (Trade Journal) or #2 (Sleep Correlator) - both are high-impact and leverage existing integrations (Schwab API, Oura)

## Flight Search: HKG → DXB (Feb 5)

Nam searching for flights from Hong Kong to Dubai for Feb 5, interested in business class award availability.

### Emirates Search Results
- **7 business class flights available** on Feb 5
- Best option: **EK383 at 18:05** (direct flight)
- Cash price: ~$4,300+ one-way business class

### Airline Account Creation Attempt (Partial)
Attempted to create accounts for award searches:

**Emirates Skywards (partial):**
- Email: alfred.flights@agentmail.to
- Name: Alfred Assist
- Title: Mr
- Password: AlfredFlights2026$Secure
- Country: United States
- ⚠️ Not completed - form complexity with DOB dropdowns, taking too long

**Cathay Asia Miles:**
- Not started

### Recommendation Given
Suggested **seats.aero Pro** ($10/mo) as better alternative for award searches:
- Aggregates availability across 20+ airlines
- Faster than creating individual airline accounts
- Good for one-off award searches

### Pending
- Nam to decide: continue account creation vs use seats.aero
- Email alfred.flights@agentmail.to created but not verified on Emirates yet

## Multi-Bot Hosting Setup (9:30 PM)

Set up system for hosting Clawdbot instances for friends/family:

**Created:**
- `~/bots/` - Multi-bot directory
- `~/bots/TEMPLATE/` - Starter workspace (AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, etc.)
- `~/bots/create-bot.sh` - Script to spin up new bots
- `~/bots/list-bots.sh` - Script to list all bots
- `~/bots/README.md` - Full documentation
- `/Users/Shared/clawdbot-skills/` - Shared skills folder

**Shared skills (public):**
- youtube-transcript, earnings-scanner, options-flow, vercel

**Private skills (not shared):**
- schwab-trader, oura-insights, sentinel, marriott-scanner

**Key decisions:**
- Each bot gets own workspace, own memory, own crons
- Bots auto-start on reboot via launchd
- Port 18789 = Nam, 18790+ = others
- Separate macOS users recommended for people who want to install/tinker

**Security notes:**
- Their bots can't read Nam's files
- Nam can technically access their stuff (admin)
- Standard users can't install system software
- User-space installs (npm, pip --user) work without admin
