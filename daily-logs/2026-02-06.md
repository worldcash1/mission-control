## Marriott Scanner — Anti-Bot Work
- Tested: Playwright, stealth plugin, Bright Data Browser API, residential proxy — all blocked by Akamai
- **Winner:** Chrome Relay (real browser + CDP) — only reliable method
- Bright Data credentials saved to `~/clawd/secrets/brightdata.env` ($24.69 balance)
- Created `~/projects/marriott-mmp/` with CDP-based scraper

## MMP Scraper Breakthrough (Late Night)
- Found GraphQL API via HAR capture: `phoenixShopADFSearchProductsByProperty`
- Direct API blocked by Akamai, but Brave + remote debugging works
- Built Discord commands: `!mmp scan <city>`, `!mmp search <city>`, `!mmp <CODE>`
- Best deals: Tokyo Four Points ¥5,790 (~$39/night), HK JW Marriott $931 HKD

## PDF Design
- Dark + light theme PDF generators built
- Nam prefers light theme
- 3 rounds of design polish (simplified colors, larger cells, row guides)
