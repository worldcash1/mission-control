## Summary
Early morning maintenance and monitoring. Nam checked in briefly from Dubai.

## Session Highlights

### System Issues Detected
- **Schwab token expired** — Refresh token authentication failed at 4:00 AM. Nam needs to re-authenticate via OAuth flow.
- **Cron model errors** — Two crons failing because `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4` not in allowed models:
  - `playtech-check` (LON:PTEC monitoring)
  - `earnings-intel-daily` (Estimize scraping)
  - Proposed fix: Update to `anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-latest`

### Communication Issue
- Nam pinged on Telegram (~4:53-5:00 AM) but my replies weren't reaching him
- Tried direct message tool send - appeared to succeed but unclear if received
- May need to investigate Telegram delivery

## Pending Items
- [ ] Schwab re-authentication (waiting on Nam)
- [ ] Fix cron model allowlist issue (waiting on Nam's approval)
- [ ] Investigate Telegram message delivery

## Routine Tasks Completed
- ✅ Workspace backup (6:00 AM)
- ✅ Local backup sync (5:30 AM, 6:30 AM)
- ✅ Error channel monitoring (clean)

## Lessons Learned
- Schwab refresh tokens expire/invalidate - need to handle this gracefully and alert promptly
- Model allowlist changes can break crons silently - good that we catch these in heartbeats
