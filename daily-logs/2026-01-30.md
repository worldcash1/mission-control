# 2026-01-30 — Discord Setup Day

## Discord Server Configured

Set up Nam's Discord server for organization. After iterating through several approaches:

**Final Structure (categories + channels):**
```
GENERAL
└── #general

TRADING
├── #trading (main convo)
├── #earnings
├── #strategies
├── #alerts
└── #trade-log

HEALTH
├── #health (main convo)
├── #oura-daily
└── #habits

PROJECTS
├── #projects (main convo)
├── #strategy-tracker
└── #alpha-research

ALFRED
├── #briefings (automated outputs)
└── #status
```

**Key decisions:**
- Categories help keep context — flat structure lost context
- Each category has a "home" channel for general conversation
- Threads spin off from channels for focused topics
- I suggest thread renames when topics evolve (Option B)
- No emojis in channel names — Nam prefers clean

**Listening:** Bot responds to all messages (no @mention required)

## Cron Jobs → Discord

Routed all briefings to Discord #briefings channel (ID: 1466712147168989315):
- Morning Brief
- THT Pre-Market, Mid-Day, Evening
- Playtech Morning/Afternoon
- Patreon Summary
- Flight Tracker

Previously went to Telegram, now all go to Discord.

## Market Discussion

- Microsoft -10% dragged market down (earnings miss)
- Fed held rates, Kevin Warsh nominated as new Fed chair
- Warsh historically hawkish (prefers fighting inflation over cutting rates)
- TLT = 20+ year Treasury bond ETF, benefits when rates fall

## Other

- Nam looking at Royal Caribbean cruise: 4-night Catalina & Ensenada, March 2-6, 2026
- Discussed Vencord/BetterDiscord for Discord theme customization
- Discord Nitro themes are just preset color schemes, not real customization

## Preferences Learned

- No emojis in channel names
- Prefers categories for organization
- Wants context preserved per topic
- All automated outputs to #briefings
