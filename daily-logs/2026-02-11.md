## Key Events

### Nam in Jakarta 🇮🇩
- Nam is in Jakarta (updated from Dubai) — didn't know about this leg of the trip
- Researched nicest malls in Jakarta: Plaza Indonesia, Plaza Senayan, Grand Indonesia top picks
- Jakarta nightlife & KTV scene — KTV is big there, also flagged SCBD rooftop bars
- **Nickel mining opportunity:** Nam's group was supposed to visit Sulawesi (Kalwasi) for nickel mines but decided against it
  - Found GEM Nickel Museum in Jakarta (Sopo Del Tower, Mega Kuningan) — 400 years of nickel history
  - Provided HQ locations for MIND ID, PT Vale Indonesia, Harita Nickel — all in SCBD/Sudirman area
  - Nam is meeting the nickel mine operator in Jakarta — prepared comprehensive question list (production capacity, processing route, offtake partners, cost/tonne, investment angle)
- Asked about national parks near Jakarta — unclear which one, sent options (TMII, Ujung Kulon, Halimun Salak, Thousand Islands)

### Trading
- Quiet earnings week — only PANW reporting Tuesday from focus tickers
- Liquid weekly options setups: ALB, APP, CSCO, NBIS, AAP, MRNA

### Maintenance

## Pending Items

## Lessons
- Nam travels more than documented — HK → Dubai → Jakarta. Keep location flexible.
