## Discussions
- **Twilio:** Account suspended, explored alternatives
- **Phone numbers:** Plivo, Telnyx, Ultra Mobile PayGo ($3/mo recommended)
- **Apple ID:** Deferred - not needed yet
- **X API:** $100/mo for Basic tier, useful for research
- **GitHub strategy:** Keep separate accounts (Alfred's for experiments, Nam's for main backup)

## Obsidian Setup
- Vault at ~/clawd/brain/
- Created 7 font CSS snippets
- Discussed themes (Minimal, Things, Prism, Blue Topaz)

## Random Requests
- Shabu shabu restaurants HK Island (Panyin, LE-TA-SU, Zenpachi recommended)
- Central restaurants (Arbor, Duddell's, Luk Yu Teahouse)

## Key Decisions
1. Everything portable in ~/clawd/
2. Don't push secrets to Alfred's public repo
3. worldcash1/alfred-brain is main backup with all credentials
4. Ask Nam for username before creating accounts
5. Apple ID skipped for now
