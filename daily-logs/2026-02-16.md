## 📊 Earnings Intel Daily Scan (6:00 AM)

**Attempted but degraded:**
- ❌ Estimize login failed - credentials invalid ("namhbca@yahoo.com" / password rejected)
- ❌ Schwab API token expired - refresh token also expired, needs manual OAuth re-auth
- ❌ Earnings scanner found 163 stocks but reported "No options" for all (likely API issue)

**What I found via web search:**
- **WMT:** Reports Feb 19 (Thu) BMO - Q4 FY2025
- **NVDA:** Reports Feb 25 (Wed) AMC @ 2pm PT - Q4 FY2026
- Big tech (AAPL, GOOGL, AMZN, MSFT, META, AMD, CRM) NOT reporting this week

**Posted to Discord #earnings-analysis:**
- Degraded mode report with confirmed dates
- Flagged API auth issues
- Action items: Fix Schwab OAuth, verify Estimize credentials

## 🔧 Action Items
1. **Schwab API:** Run OAuth flow to get new tokens (refresh token expired)
2. **Estimize:** Login may need to be renewed (trial period Feb 2 - Feb 23)
3. **Convex database:** Couldn't find earnings-intel project to update database

## 💡 Notes
- Earnings scanner skill exists and should work once Schwab API is restored
- Estimize integration is built into earnings-scanner with `--estimize` flag
- Need to check if Estimize trial is still active or if account needs renewal

## 4:03 PM - Cron Re-Run (Earnings Intel Daily)

**Manual verification of Estimize access:**
- Attempted browser login with `~/clawd/secrets/estimize.env` credentials
- Result: **"Invalid email or password"** (namhbca@yahoo.com)
- Confirmed: Estimize free tier now **hides crowd consensus** (requires subscription)
- Can only see: Wall St consensus, # contributors, report dates, historical actuals
- **Cannot see:** Estimize consensus (needed for divergence calculations)

**Focus tickers with earnings this week:**
- WMT: 02/19/26 BMO - Wall St $0.73 EPS (20 Estimize contributors, consensus hidden)
- NVDA: 02/25/26 AMC - Wall St $1.52 EPS (108 Estimize contributors, consensus hidden)

**Posted to Discord #earnings-analysis:**
- Confirmed data limitation (Estimize paywall)
- Flagged invalid credentials
- Recommended password reset or pivot to alternative data sources
- Suggested alternative: options flow analysis + implied moves instead of Estimize divergence

**Action:** Wait for Nam to decide: fix Estimize login vs subscribe vs pivot to different data source

## 🧠 Auto-Extracted Insights

### New Projects
- **Polymarket Insider Scanner** — Building a scanner to detect sharp/insider bettors on Polymarket
  - Goals: Identify wallets with edge via timing, win rates, funding patterns, bet sizing
  - Architecture: CLI tool + wallet scoring + cluster detection + real-time alerts
  - Tech: TypeScript, SQLite (local), Convex (dashboard later)
  - APIs: Gamma (markets), Data (trades), CLOB (prices), on-chain (Polygon CTFExchange)
  - Sub-agent spawned to build `~/bin/polymarket-scan` CLI

### Preferences & Patterns
- **Project scoping**: Nam asks "what signals would you add?" — wants collaborative design before building
- **Database choice**: Prefers SQLite for heavy scanning/analysis (speed, cost) → Convex for dashboards/multi-user later
- **Building approach**: Spawn sub-agents for substantial coding, incremental builds (API → DB → scoring → alerts)
- **Output style**: Clean CLI, table formatting for terminal use

### Technical Decisions
- **Scanner targets**: New wallets, large bets, win rate anomalies (>70% on 10+ bets), wallet clusters, one-shot insiders
- **Edge detection**: First-mover analysis, timing before news, odds indifference, PnL step-functions
- **One-shot insider handling**: Can't predict, but detect fast enough to tail trades + cluster via funding/exit patterns

### Pain Points Observed
- Schwab API still blocked from Mac Mini (Dubai cellular needed or wait until back in US)
- Estimize credentials invalid + free tier now hides crowd consensus (paywall)

## 🌙 Evening Summary
- **Schwab token:** Dead all day, refresh script ran 20+ times — needs manual OAuth from residential IP
- **GitHub backup:** polymarket.db (108MB) exceeded GitHub limit — excluded via .gitignore, rewrote history, pushed successfully
- **Local backup:** rsync to ~/Documents/alfred-backup/ completed
- **Health (Oura):** Readiness 62, Sleep 64, HRV critically low (17-24ms), high stress — recovery day recommended
- **Nam driving:** Adelanto → OC, helped find Tesla Supercharger + In-N-Out (Cabazon/Barstow)
- **Estimize:** Decision needed by Feb 23 — keep ($99/mo) or cancel

## 📌 Pending for Tomorrow
1. Schwab OAuth re-auth (needs Nam on residential IP)
2. Estimize decision (keep/cancel)
3. Markets: WMT earnings Wed BMO, NVDA next Tue AMC
4. Polymarket Insider Scanner — check sub-agent build progress
