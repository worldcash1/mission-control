---

## DailyLingo — Chinese Learning App ✅

**Repo:** github.com/worldcash1/dailylingo

**Stack:** Next.js 14 + Tailwind + shadcn/ui + Convex + Google Cloud TTS

### Philosophy: Pareto Phrases
- Polyglots learn fast through high-leverage phrases that compound
- ~100 most common words = 50% of all speech
- Teach patterns, not vocabulary — "我想要..." unlocks thousands of sentences
- Phrases grouped by topic, each building on previous patterns

### Features Built
- 80 pre-generated audio files via Google Cloud TTS
- Library view with topic categories
- Topic badges during learning
- About modal with philosophy and vision
- Dark theme with purple/pink gradient design system
- Spaced repetition tracking (userProgress table)
- Daily stats tracking

### Phrase Categories (80 total)
- **Core Patterns (24):** 我是, 我要, 我想要, 有没有, 可以
- **Survival (18):** 你好, 谢谢, 多少钱, 在哪里
- **Food (8):** 我饿了, 好吃, 买单, 不要辣
- **Directions (7):** 怎么走, 左边/右边, 洗手间在哪里
- **Social (5):** 我叫, 很高兴认识你
- **Numbers (6):** 一 through 一百
- **Time (6):** 现在, 今天, 明天, 几点

### Database Schema (Convex)
- `phrases` — chinese, pinyin, english, topic, difficulty, audioUrl
- `userProgress` — spaced repetition (interval, easeFactor, nextReview)
- `stats` — daily learning metrics

### Commits (9 total)
1. Initial commit: Next.js + shadcn/ui + Convex setup
2. Add project rules (CLAUDE.md + .cursorrules)
3. Add global rules + BUG_SOLUTIONS.md
4. Rename to DailyLingo

## Disaster Recovery

### What Happened
- Nam ran "full reset" thinking it was "restart"
- Workspace wiped: all memory files, Obsidian vault, projects
- Telegram + gateway config survived

### Recovery Steps
1. Found backup in `alfred-brain` repo on GitHub (Jan 26 snapshot)
2. Restored 231 files including brain/, memory/, knowledge/
3. Set up git protection for workspace → github.com/worldcash1/clawd-workspace
4. Recovered Jan 27 work from GitHub commit history

### Protection Measures Added
- Workspace now git-tracked with automatic commits
- Backup repo: github.com/worldcash1/clawd-workspace
- Lesson: Keep Obsidian vault outside workspace in future

### Still Exists

## Pending
- [ ] Complete Telegram export (24-hour security wait, available Jan 28)
- [ ] Redo Schwab OAuth
- [ ] Recreate cron jobs
- [ ] Move brain/ vault outside workspace (symlink back)
