## 🧠 Auto-Extracted Insights

### Schwab Token — Persistent Daily Expiry (NEW PATTERN)
Schwab access token expired 3× in one day (4 AM, 8 AM, 12 PM runs) — auto-recovered each time via refresh_token, but this is now day 2+ of a recurring pattern. The auto-refresh is working but the token lifecycle doesn't survive multi-day operation without re-auth. **Refresh_token hard expires Feb 26 — OAuth re-auth required before then.** Escalation flagged to #errors on 3rd consecutive hit.

### Discord Message Routing Friction (REINFORCED)
The `message` tool always routes to Telegram. Discord posts require direct REST API calls via curl or Python — this came up 5+ times today across multiple cron sessions (EOD recap, earnings scanner, morning pipeline, AI trends). Every Discord-posting cron now implicitly requires a curl/REST fallback. This should be codified in the Discord CLI or a wrapper.

### xAI Credits — Day 2 Depletion
Grok (xAI) credits remain depleted for a second day. The EOD recap and morning sessions fell back to Perplexity/web_search successfully. No operational impact yet, but worth tracking if this becomes day 3+.

### X API Monthly Cap — Hit Again
X read cap exhausted again. Both AI Trends runs (AM + PM) fell back to web_search compilation. The fallback is solid but loses direct engagement metrics. Cap resets monthly — note the reset date.

### SSH Education Request — Nam's Knowledge Level
Nam asked "what is SSH, can you help me understand and learn?" — This signals he wants foundational tech education occasionally, not just task execution. He's interested in understanding the tools his systems use, not just using them. Explain technical concepts clearly with analogies.

### Brother's OpenClaw Setup — Pending Decision
Nam's brother set up his own OpenClaw but isn't technical. Discussion of two options: (1) his own Mac Mini he can't maintain, vs (2) separate macOS user on Nam's Mac Mini. Nam hasn't decided yet. Option 2 is recommended (easier maintenance, single machine).

### Model Trial — Sonnet 4.6
Alfred proactively checked in on the Sonnet 4.6 trial (been ~1 day). Nam didn't respond in this session — check-in is pending.

### Social Arb Cron — Pipeline Working, Bright Data TikTok Blocked
The social-arb cron ran successfully at 3 AM. Google Trends below baseline (no spikes). Bright Data is KYC-blocked for TikTok — browser fallback was used to scrape TikTok Creative Center directly. Cross-referenced earnings calendar: CROX (Feb 20), CELH + BROS + SN + OLPX (Feb 26–27) all in prime window.

### Earnings Tracker Pipeline Resilience
The morning earnings pipeline was SIGTERM'd during a 30-min sleep window (between Stage 2 and Stage 3). Alfred detected the kill, checked logs, and manually resumed from Stage 3 to completion. The pipeline ran all 5 stages, 51 tickers, 70.6% win rate. This shows the current pipeline design lacks crash recovery — it should checkpoint stages.

### WMT Guide Disappointment Pattern
WMT beat EPS ($0.74 vs $0.73) but gave FY27 guide $2.75-2.85 vs $2.97 consensus — stock fell 3%. Classic "beat + guide down = sell" pattern. Confirmed that for WMT specifically, guidance matters more than the quarter.

## 📋 Daily Summary — Feb 19, 2026

### Overview
Heavy automation day. All major crons ran. Markets broadly up. Busy earnings day (WMT, DE, ETSY, BABA). Multiple infrastructure quirks (Schwab token, xAI credits, X API cap, Discord routing) all handled via fallbacks. Nam had light direct interaction — mostly system-driven day.

### Session Highlights

**🌙 Night Shift (pre-market):**
- Social arb pipeline ran at ~3 AM. TikTok scraped via browser (Bright Data blocked). No Google Trends spikes. Earnings cross-ref: CROX (tomorrow), CELH/BROS (next week) flagged.
- Marriott scanner: Bright Data bot detection still fighting Akamai. Network-idle timeout issue on AJAX-heavy pages — wait strategy needs fixing.
- WMT pre-earnings setup built (Iron Fly analysis). Verdict: risky sell, overpriced IV but buyers sometimes win historically.
- Schwab auto-refresh daemon drafted.

**📊 Morning Earnings Pipeline (6 AM–7 AM):**
- 51 tickers scanned. 70.6% final win rate (36W/15L).
- Pipeline SIGTERM'd during sleep; Alfred manually resumed from Stage 3.
- Morning spread rankings: 10 tickers (HLT, MAR, DASH, RBLX, LULU, ABNB, etc.), OQuants + Convex updated.
- No tight spreads — lightest day.

**📰 Earnings Intel Cron (6 AM):**
- WMT: Beat EPS, weak FY27 guide → stock -3%
- DE: +14.7% EPS beat, construction/forestry +111%
- BABA: Miss -2.5%, cloud +34%
- ETSY: Beat +8.2%, Depop sold to eBay $1.2B → stock +21.4% AH
- Upcoming: NVDA Feb 25 ($1.52 EPS est), LOW Feb 25

**🤖 API Health (4 AM / 8 AM / 12 PM):**
- Schwab token expired 3× consecutively — auto-recovered all 3 times
- X/Twitter and Finnhub: persistent WARN
- All others: green

**🤖 AI Trends (AM + PM):**
- X API cap hit — web_search fallback
- Top stories: Altman vs. Amodei handshake snub at India AI Summit with PM Modi; Google Gemini 3.1 Pro launch (77.1% ARC-AGI-2); Lyria 3 music gen; World Labs $1B close (Fei-Fei Li); Pentagon vs. Anthropic $200M

**📉 EOD Recap (4 PM):**
- Markets: S&P +0.6%, Nasdaq +0.8%, VIX -3.3% → 19.62, BTC +1.3% → $67,088
- WMT -3% (guide miss), HIMS bounced from 52W low on Eucalyptus $1.15B deal, IREN +2.9%, PLTR DHS $1B BPA, NVDA +1.6% pre-earnings
- xAI credits depleted (day 2) — Perplexity fallback
- Discord: 4-part message sent via REST API curl

**💡 Daily Ideas:**
- Polymarket bulk wallet promoter CLI (fix 6,427 stuck wallets)
- NVDA Iron Butterfly setup
- Schwab token auto-refresh daemon
- AI-native earnings playbook
- Browser session persistence pattern

**💬 Direct Interactions:**
- Nam shared @ethanrkho X link (tweet unscrapable)
- Nam asked about setting up OpenClaw for his non-technical brother
- Nam asked "what is SSH?" — gave beginner tutorial
- Model trial check-in (Sonnet 4.6)
- @tolibear_ article: "Give agents souls not just skills" — 1,097 bookmarks, very relevant to our SOUL.md setup

### Decisions Made
- PLTR: No immediate action despite DHS win — ICE optics a drag
- WMT: Risky sell on IV; chose to watch, not enter straddle
- No earnings trades today (Friday = lightest day, widest spreads)

### Pending / Action Items
| Item | Due | Priority |
|------|-----|----------|
| Schwab OAuth re-auth | Before Feb 26 | 🔴 Hard deadline |
| HIMS earnings | Feb 23 (binary) | 🔴 Watch |
| NVDA Q4 earnings | Feb 25 AMC | 🔴 Systemic |
| DUOL + DELL earnings | Feb 26 | 🟡 |
| PCE print | Feb 20 premarket | 🟡 Macro risk |
| IREN: mining difficulty | Feb 20 | 🟡 |
| Brother's OpenClaw setup | TBD | 🟡 |
| Polymarket wallet promoter CLI | TBD | 🟢 |
| Marriott scanner Bright Data fix | TBD | 🟢 |
| Discord posting wrapper (curl CLI) | TBD | 🟢 |

### Lessons Learned
- Schwab token can't sustain multi-day rotation on refresh_token alone — plan for weekly OAuth re-auth
- Earnings pipelines need stage checkpointing for SIGTERM resilience
- Discord message routing is a persistent friction point — needs a dedicated CLI wrapper in ~/bin/
- TikTok: Bright Data KYC-blocked; browser scrape is the reliable fallback
- WMT: guidance > quarter every time. Don't straddle into guide-miss risk
