- **OpenAI removed "safely" from mission statement** — major controversy on X
- **ChatGPT running ads**: Williams-Sonoma & Target first testers
- AMD MI440 signals (on-prem thesis); NVDA earnings Feb 25, DELL Feb 26 — back-to-back longs

### 🔧 System / Infra
- **Schwab API token expired** → multiple failed refresh crons spammed all morning
  - Disabled `schwab-token-refresh` cron (was running every 25min pointlessly)
  - Nam attempted manual OAuth re-auth from Dubai — failed (possible regional block or app deactivation)
  - **Status: Still down** — needs manual re-auth at developer.schwab.com from non-Dubai IP
  - Auto-refreshed at 8pm API health check (Schwab API recovered temporarily)
- **X/Twitter**: Rate limited (monthly cap exceeded) — Sentinel market scan unavailable, fell back to web_search for EOD recap
- **xAI credits exhausted** (team limit) — Grok search unavailable for EOD recap
- **Daily Ideas cron** had routing bug (tried Telegram for Discord announcement) → fixed (delivery set to `none`)
- **gog not linked** — Google calendar/tasks unavailable; run `gog auth login` to fix
- **Auto-backup 4pm**: 14 files committed & pushed to git ✅
- **Apple ID iCloud sign-in alert** in agentmail inbox — verify it's legit

### 💡 Daily Ideas (posted to Discord #ideas)
1. `gap-scan` CLI — score dead-cat bounce vs continuation on AH earnings misses (CVNA/DASH pattern)
2. Local MCP Server for Trading — wire Schwab positions + Polymarket + earnings calendar into one endpoint
3. DUOL Iron Condor (Feb 26) — RSI <30, IV elevated, sell premium instead of adding longs
4. HIMS Bull Call Spread (Feb 23) — 52-week low, earnings catalyst potential, defined-risk play
5. Polymarket bulk wallet promo — 6,427 wallets with win-rate data unused; one bulk-insert unlocks sharp-bettor detection

### 💬 Direct Interactions
- Nam was unresponsive early morning while multiple Schwab reminders fired; came online ~12:28am PT saying "hi already"
- Around 10pm: Asked how to set up OpenClaw for a friend → provided full install instructions (npm + configure + API key)

### 📅 Upcoming
- **Tomorrow BMO**: WMT + BABA earnings — WMT straddle spread 6.3% (tightest setup)
- **Feb 23**: HIMS earnings
- **Feb 25**: NVDA earnings (core on-prem long)
- **Feb 26**: DELL earnings + DUOL earnings ($236K position)
- **Friday**: PCE print

## 🧠 Auto-Extracted Insights

- **Pattern — Sleep debt compound risk**: Two consecutive nights under 5h sleep with dropping HRV. When readiness <70 and sleep balance <40, Nam is in cognitive debt territory. Flag proactively on day 2+.
- **Pattern — Schwab OAuth fragility**: Token has expired twice in recent weeks. The refresh script is insufficient without periodic full re-auth. Consider adding a "Schwab OAuth health check" weekly cron that detects dead refresh tokens before they cascade into all-morning spam alerts.
- **Pattern — xAI credits burn fast**: Team limit hit mid-month. Grok is a fallback for X search; when credits exhaust, EOD recaps silently degrade. Worth monitoring credit burn rate and topping up proactively.
- **Pattern — Cron delivery routing bugs**: Isolated job announcements attempted to route through Telegram (wrong channel). Fixed by setting `delivery: none` — the job's own message tool handles posting. This pattern likely applies to other crons too; audit delivery configs.
- **Decision — Nam wants OpenClaw for a friend**: Expressed interest in sharing/onboarding around 10pm. Could indicate intent to grow the user base or set up a separate instance.
- **Interest — Earnings infrastructure**: Convex earnings schema still undeployed (spec-only); earnings-tracker pipeline ran but couldn't persist quotes due to both schema gap and expired Schwab token. Core blocker for building historical earnings database.
