# 2026-02-15 (Sunday)

## Highlights
- Schwab token expired overnight, flagged via API health alerts in #errors
- Nam re-authed Schwab — token refreshed successfully at ~6:50am
- Discord cron error: tried to edit message authored by another user (1471246583684403327) — needs cron fix
- Nam asked about Discord vs Slack for OpenClaw — recommended staying on Discord (free, already set up)
- Auto-backups running smoothly (git + rsync)

## Decisions
- Stick with Discord over Slack for OpenClaw

## Pending
- Fix Discord cron that tries to edit wrong message ID
- Schwab token auto-refresh now working again
- Sunday checks (lessons review, CLI health) — skipped, early morning

## Lessons
- Schwab refresh tokens expire after 7 days — consider adding proactive warnings at day 5-6
