## Highlights
- Schwab token expired overnight, re-authed ~6:50am, then expired again ~8:25pm (IP block from Dubai)
- Oura crisis: Readiness 41, Sleep 27, only 3h24m sleep, previous night score 1/100
- Weekly Oura summary: avg readiness 61.6 (-6.1), sleep debt accumulating (44→32)
- Weekly sentiment deep dive: major rotation tech→value, AAII 11% bullish, NVDA Feb 25 earnings key
- Coiled earnings scan: CVNA (32.5% SI, Feb 19) and BYND (35.2% SI) top squeeze candidates
- HIK.L at £15.77, earnings Feb 26 (11 days)
- Night shift: Marriott scanner hit Akamai bot detection, solution drafted (real browser approach)
- 5 build ideas generated — top picks: Earnings Trade Autopilot, Portfolio Risk Monitor
- Nam asked about Discord vs Slack for OpenClaw — recommended staying Discord
- Started Telegram Topics/Forum setup for organized Alfred comms
- Nam researching sleep supplements: CBD, cannabis, magnesium, REM vs deep sleep

## Decisions
- Stick with Discord over Slack
- Telegram Topics group "Alfred bot" created, pending config

## Pending
- Schwab re-auth (needs residential IP, blocked from Dubai)
- Telegram Topics group setup — enable topics, add bot, update config
- Discord cron edit error (message 1471246583684403327) — wrong author
- Build priorities: Earnings Trade Autopilot + Portfolio Risk Monitor

## Lessons
- Schwab blocks datacenter/server IPs (Akamai CDN) — need residential browser for auth
- Cannabis suppresses REM; CBD does not — CBD + indica combo preserves REM better
- Sleep total time is the #1 metric; REM fixes itself with adequate duration
