# $HOOD - Robinhood

**Sector:** Fintech / Brokerage

## Thesis (Chris Camillo - Dumb Money)

### The BTC Correlation Trade
> "If there's ever a massive move in Bitcoin up or down, there's always an equivalent, if not even bigger move in Robin Hood, but LATER."

**Why it works:**
- HOOD AUM heavily weighted to crypto
- When BTC drops 40%, HOOD accounts drop 40% → hurts revenue
- When BTC pumps, retail comes back, trading volume spikes
- **The lag = your edge** (ARB opportunity)

### The Play
- BTC pumps → wait for confirmation
- Buy HOOD calls before the move catches up
- Works on reversals especially well

### Chris's Position
- Top 3 holding (with AMZN, Bloom Energy, NVDA)
- Bought calls during the crash
- "Already exited my Robin Hood options" (took profits on bounce)

## Notes

### 2026-02-06
- BTC → HOOD correlation alert set up
- Checks 3x daily (7am, 10am, 2pm) on market days
- Alerts when BTC +3% or more
