# $AMZN - Amazon

**Sector:** Tech / E-commerce / Cloud / AI Infrastructure

## Thesis (Chris Camillo - Dumb Money)

### The Core Question
> "Where are they gonna get their computing power from?"

Everyone building AI needs compute. Amazon/AWS is the warehouse. They literally cannot build fast enough.

### CapEx Reality
- **$200B** announced CapEx (was $150B expected) — scared Wall Street
- **$515 million PER DAY** on AI infrastructure
- **$240B pipeline** of demand (up 22% QoQ) — customers WAITING
- "Monetizing capacity as fast as they can install it"

### Why This is Classic Amazon
- **Every major Amazon CapEx spend looked ugly upfront** → printed cash later
- AWS, Prime, Fulfillment — all hated when announced, all crushed it
- Jassy is the FOUNDER of AWS (2003), not a "wannabe" — he built this
- They play the long game better than anyone (lost money for 15 years on retail)

### Hidden Anthropic Value 🔥
- **15-17% stake in Anthropic** — NOT on balance sheet yet
- Anthropic IPO coming → likely **$100B+ gain** for Amazon
- May earnings: expect **$10-13B markup** on Anthropic holding
- Tranium chips specifically built around Claude models (years of investment)
- "Claude having a moment right now is MASSIVE for Amazon"

### Tranium Custom Silicon
- **$10B+ annual business** growing at TRIPLE DIGITS
- Tranium 3 coming (40% efficiency improvement)
- Already in discussions for Tranium 4 AND Tranium 5
- Better margins than buying Nvidia GPUs

### Other Underappreciated Assets
- **Advertising:** Should be valued at **~$500B** alone (based on Meta/Netflix comps)
- **Retail:** Now a CASH ENGINE (no longer a drag after 15+ years)
- **Scale moat:** Few companies can spend this much, this fast, with this customer base

### Valuation
- Trading at **17x next year's cash flow** — not Palantir-level ridiculous
- "Asymmetric risk/reward" — stable company with massive upside
- "How is Amazon only a $2 trillion company right now?"

### The Setup (Feb 2026)
- Stock crashed 10% on CapEx announcement — IRRATIONAL
- Revenue up 14%, AWS up 24% — BEAT expectations
- Missed earnings by 2 cents — who cares
- This is the moment to buy (like Apple before it popped)

## Chris's Position
- 11% of net worth in AMZN (wants MORE)
- Bought calls for May earnings (Anthropic markup catalyst)
- "I have been in Amazon for two decades"
- "94% of liquid account in Bloom, Amazon, Nvidia, Robin Hood"

## Key Risks
- Bezos selling shares (as usual)
- Potential shelf offering (dilution for CapEx)
- OpenAI investment announcement (market won't like it short-term)
- Macro instability

## Action Items
🔔 **DAILY REMINDER: BUY AMAZON**
📅 **May earnings:** Watch for Anthropic markup ($10-13B)
🎯 **Listen to the earnings call** — "If you don't start there, I don't even know what you're doing"
