# $BE - Bloom Energy

**Sector:** Energy / Fuel Cells
**Source:** Chris Camillo (Dumb Money) - His #1 Position

## Thesis

### The "Bring Your Own Power" Play
Data centers are getting pushback from municipalities over grid strain. Solution: on-site power generation.

> "Bring your own power might be the biggest tailwind Bloom Energy could ever wish for."

### What Bloom Does
- Fuel cells that generate DC power directly from natural gas
- On-site power for data centers (no grid dependency)
- Now adding **absorption chillers** using waste heat → cuts electricity usage 20%+
- "Power + cooling from one platform"

### Why It's Underappreciated
- Not covered by tech analysts (it's an energy company)
- Most people don't understand how it works
- Engineers who dig in: "Holy smokes, that's insane"

### The Catalyst — CONFIRMED ✅

**Texas Senate Bill 6 (SB6)** — Signed into law June 2025
- Large data centers must have backup generation capability
- Remote-disconnect required for grid emergencies (after Dec 31, 2025)
- ERCOT can mandate deployment of backup generators
- Essentially "pay your own way" / "bring your own power"

**Federal level:** Congress discussing requiring data centers to "build new generation plants" (Bring Your Own Power approach)

**Canada:** Already implementing similar requirements

> "Texas Gets Tough on Data Center Power — Who's Next?" (Data Center Knowledge, Feb 2026)

**Why this matters for Bloom:**
- On-site fuel cells = perfect solution for these mandates
- No grid dependency = compliance built-in
- As more states follow Texas → demand for Bloom explodes
- Chris: "If this spreads state-by-state → massive tailwind"

### Chris's Take
> "If everything plays out perfectly, this could be a 4 or 5x stock."

- His **#1 position**
- 94% of liquid portfolio in: Bloom, Amazon, Nvidia, Robin Hood

## Recent Earnings (Feb 2026)
- Beat EPS: 45¢ vs 31¢ expected
- Revenue: $777.7M vs $652M expected (+35.9% YoY)
- Higher product/service sales, improving margins
- Stock opened +$17, then pulled back (typical Bloom volatility)

## Notes

### 2026-02-06
- Added to watchlist
- Chris's conviction: 4-5x potential
- "Bring your own power" trend is the catalyst
