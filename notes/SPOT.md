# $SPOT - Spotify

**Sector:** Tech / Streaming
**Setup:** THT Fair Value Band (Monthly)

## Technical Setup (Feb 7, 2026)

**Entry Signal:** Hit monthly FVB (Fair Value Band)
- Price: ~$422 (down 15.5% on the month)
- Touched the 1-month Fair Value zone
- THT BX Trender still green on monthly
- Multi-timeframe signal supportive

## Chart Notes
- Big run from ~$200 (2024) to $500+ (late 2025)
- Now pulling back to fair value = potential buy zone
- Monthly candle showing significant pullback

## Trade Idea
**Sell puts** — Premium selling at FVB
- If assigned → buying at fair value (good entry)
- If not assigned → collect premium
- Win-win at this level

## THT Methodology
- FVB touch on higher timeframe = high probability entry
- Look for confirmation on lower timeframes
- Scale in approach per "Monthly BX Trender - Scale Out Strategy"
