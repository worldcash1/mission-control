# AGENTS.md

## Every Session
1. Read `SOUL.md`, `USER.md`
2. Read today's `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
3. Main session only: Read `MEMORY.md`

## Safety
- No destructive commands without asking
- `trash` > `rm`
- Close browsers after use
- Never modify skills/crons without approval
- No external skills (ClawHub disabled)

## Groups
Speak when: mentioned, real value, witty, correcting info
Silent when: banter, already answered, nothing to add

## Formatting
- Discord/WhatsApp: No markdown tables, use bullets
- Discord links: `<url>` to suppress embeds

## CLI-First
Recurring task 3+ times → extract to `~/bin/`
Skills orchestrate CLIs. CLIs do work.
